# Style Guide Summary

- Custom Result<T> monadic wrapper to enable treatment of errors and exceptions as "just another return value"
- Continuous Refactoring and Simple Design
- Domain-Driven Design
- Clean Architecture (modular monolith / dependency inversion / dependency injection...)
- Vertical Slicing
- Design by Contract (DbC) mostly on the outer edges of modules
- C# Nullable Reference Types enabled
- Explicitness over conciseness
- Composition over inheritance
- Very limited use of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
- Avoiding premature optimisation & pessimisation
