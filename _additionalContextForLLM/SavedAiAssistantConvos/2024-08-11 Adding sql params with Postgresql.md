User: 
when adding parameters to a NpgsqlCommand, I see two options:
.AddWithValue(), which takes a kvp (string, object)
and
.Add() which takes an object of type NpgsqlParameter, which itself is constructed with parameter name, data type and then has a Value property for the actual value of the parameter. 

Currently I'm using both approaches, mixed. The .AddWithValue for straightforward cases e.g. for parameters of type int, string etc. but the .Add() e.g. for code like this:


```c#
command.Parameters.Add(
    new NpgsqlParameter("@tlgMessageDetails", NpgsqlDbType.Jsonb)
    {
        Value = JsonHelper.SerializeToJson(tlgInput.Details, Glossary)
    });
```

I'm now thinking, for increased code clarity, to just use a single approach, and then use internal helper methods. 
Am I right that I am forced to use .Add (and/or .AddRange) rather than .AddWithValue  because the latter doesn't allow specifying the DbType?? 

For example I now also need to do things like

addInputWithResultantWorkflowInfoCommand.Parameters.Add(new NpgsqlParameter("@dstUserIds", NpgsqlDbType.Array | NpgsqlDbType.Bigint)
{
Value = destinations.Select(d => d.DstUserId.Id).ToArray()
});


or is this a mistaken assumption?

Assistant: 
Based on Npgsql documentation and common practices, it is correct to say that `Parameters.Add()` is more flexible and generally recommended. This is because `Parameters.AddWithValue()` has some drawbacks.

The reason is that Npgsql type handling lets you map PostgreSQL types to CLR types, and this happens automatically without you having to specify a specific type. When you use `Parameters.AddWithValue()`, it infers the PostgreSQL type from the value provided.

But in some scenarios, you might want to control the type mapping explicitly. For instance, as in your case, if you are using a JSONB or an ARRAY data type, you would want to use `Parameters.Add()` which allows explicit specification of the PostgreSQL type.

Here's how you could use `Parameters.Add()`:

```csharp
command.Parameters.Add(new NpgsqlParameter("@param", NpgsqlDbType.Jsonb) { Value = jsonValue });
```

And here's the usage with `Parameters.AddWithValue()`:

```csharp
command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@param", jsonValue);
```

In the second example, Npgsql infers the PostgreSQL type from the .NET type of `jsonValue`, which could result in incorrect data type mappings that generate errors.

In conclusion, your initial assumption is correct: If you need to specify the `DbType`, `Parameters.Add()` is the preferred approach. This provides you with more control over the type mapping to PostgreSQL data types.
