User: 
what's idiomatic in C# in terms of the order of members in a class: to constants come before private fields or vice versa?

Assistant: 
There is no universally fixed order of class members in C#, though the order recommended by the .NET Design Guidelines (and thus generally followed by many C# developers) is:

1. Constants
2. Read-only static fields
3. Static Fields
4. Read-only fields
5. Fields
6. Constructors
7. Finalizers (Destructors)
8. Delegates
9. Events
10. Enums
11. Interfaces
12. Properties
13. Indexers
14. Methods

However, it's always best to follow the conventions used in the particular codebase you're working on, as different teams can have different standards for ordering class members.
