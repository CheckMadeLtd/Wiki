Can npgsql load straightforward relational data from multiple tables into an object graph without custom code? We don't have circular dependencies and use straightforward one to many or one to one relationships in our tables, represented normally with FKs. 

Assistant: 
Yes, npgsql can load relational data from multiple tables into an object graph without custom code. However, you need to rely on some form of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to automate the process and shape the queried data into a predefined object model. 

There are various ORM frameworks you can use in .NET. Entity Framework (EF) and Dapper are popular choices. Entity Framework Core includes a feature called "eager loading" which allows related data to be loaded from the database as part of the initial query; this might meet your needs.

Here is an example of fetching data from multiple related tables using Entity Framework Core:

```csharp
var customers = context.Customers
    .Include(customer => customer.Orders)
        .ThenInclude(order => order.OrderDetails)
    .ToList();
```

In this example, 'Customers', 'Orders', and 'OrderDetails' are tables in a relational database. With the `.Include()` and `.ThenInclude()` methods, Entity Framework Core performs a join operation on the related tables and loads the related data. 

Dapper also can map complex object graphs and automatically handle object relation, relationships such as one-to-one and one-to-many can be mapped with Dapper using Multi Mapping feature.

Here is an example using Dapper:
```csharp
var sql = 
@"
select * from #Posts p 
left join #Users u on u.Id = p.OwnerId 
Order by p.Id";

var data = connection.Query<Post, User, Post>(sql, (post, user) => { post.Owner = user; return post;});
var post = data.First();

Assert.Equal("Sams Post1", post.Content);
Assert.Equal(1, post.Id);
Assert.Equal("Sam", post.Owner.Name);
Assert.Equal(1, post.Owner.Id);
```
In the above example Dapper is performing a `JOIN` operation on Posts and Users based on `OwnerId` and mapping each of the rows into a `Post` object, and assigning the corresponding `User` to the Owner property inside the `Post`. 

Remember when using Dapper:
- The order of parameters should be as they are returned from the query
- The `splitOn` argument should be the Id (or another split point) 

Please note that depending on how your data and relationships are structured, loading data eagerly might not always be the best option performance-wise. Always consider the trade-offs between the number of database round-trips and the complexity and redundancy of the retrieved datasets. 

That being said, using an ORM like Entity Framework Core or Dapper can help you avoid writing custom code to load straightforward relational data from multiple tables into an object graph.

User: 
So npgsql itself can't do that? Even with very straightforward one to many relationship between two tables, using an FK? I'd avoid EF Core btw and rely on Dapper if need be, but preference would be not to use any ORM. 

Assistant: 
You're correct. Npgsql by itself, as a pure ADO.NET data provider, doesn't provide direct support to load relational data from multiple tables into complex object graphs without any custom code. Its main purpose is to facilitate communication and data retrieval between your .NET application and PostgreSQL databases on a lower level.

Therefore, when working with Npgsql, you would generally need to manually map the returned data to your application's object model. This does mean that you would have to handle things like loading related data (i.e., handling JOIN operations) and filling out your objects manually.

For complex scenarios with multiple related entities, this can become quite cumbersome, and this is where an ORM like Dapper or Entity Framework can provide significant benefits. With their support for advanced query capabilities and object mapping, handling such scenarios becomes a lot more convenient.

Though, if your relationships are straightforward and your object graph is not complex, you can indeed write your own mapping logic with raw SQL and manually populate your object graphs.

Here is an example using Npgsql without an ORM, by executing a `JOIN` query and mapping the data to objects manually:

```csharp
string sql = "SELECT * FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.table1_id";
NpgsqlCommand command = new NpgsqlCommand(sql, conn);
NpgsqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();

while (reader.Read())
{
    var entity1 = new Entity1
    {
        Id = (int)reader["id"],
        //other properties
    };

    var entity2 = new Entity2
    {
        Id = (int)reader["id"],
        //other properties
    };

    entity1.Entity2 = entity2;

    //Add entity1 to list or whatever you want to do with it
}
```

This allows you to manually map fields from your query to properties on your objects, without the use of an ORM. But as you can see, this requires significantly more manual work than using an ORM.

If you aim to avoid using full-featured ORMs like Entity Framework, but you also want to avoid writing custom mapping code, Dapper is indeed a great middle ground as it is a simple object mapper for .NET and doesn't carry the extra weight of a full-fledged ORM while still simplifying object mapping from SQL queries.

User: 
Does Dapper require that we add attributes or 'id' fields to my domain POCOs which would not be required by the domain logic itself? As is the case with EF Core? I'd hope not.  I'd want to avoid that and if that's the case I'd want a separate set of objects that just act as intermediaries? Or ist that too much overhead? 

Assistant: 
Dapper is designed to be unobtrusive and focuses mainly on the direct mapping between SQL queries and your POCO objects. As such, it does not require you to decorate your classes and properties with attributes, unlike Entity Framework Core which requires attributes or fluent API configurations for defining relationships and other database mappings.

What Dapper primarily depends on is the alignment between your SQL query results and your POCO property names. It uses the names to infer and match the data. For example:

```csharp
public class MyPoco
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

string sql = "SELECT id, name FROM MyTable";
var myPocos = connection.Query<MyPoco>(sql);
```

Dapper will map the "id" and "name" fields from the query result to the corresponding properties of `MyPoco` class.

However, in cases where your domain models do not match directly with your database schema (e.g., different property names), you can handle this within the SQL query itself by using aliases:

```csharp
string sql = "SELECT column_name1 AS PropertyName1, column_name2 AS PropertyName2 FROM MyTable";
var myPocos = connection.Query<MyPoco>(sql);
```

In such a scenario, you will not need to pollute your domain models with database-specific details. Although in complex cases where there's a significant mismatch between your domain and data models, using intermediary Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) that precisely match the database schema may be a better solution. These DTOs help to keep your domain model clean from persistence details.

It's a valid approach, and it does add a level of separation and isolation, but it also introduces additional complexity and can increase maintenance. The decision between using intermediary DTOs and aliasing within queries will depend on the specifics of your project, such as the complexity of your data model, the nature of the domain model, and the extent of mismatch between the two.
