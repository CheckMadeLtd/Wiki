User: 
Ok next question. Elsewhere in my code, here an example where I access the value of MessageDetails.Text (which is now of type Option<string>):

'message.Details.Text'

In order to access the actual value, I'd now need to add e.g.  '.GetValueOrDefault' right?

That's fine, but I'm just wondering whether it makes sense to implement another implicit operator where when I access an instance of Option<string>, it by default returns the return value of .GetValueOrDefault  so I can make my syntax everywhere in the code more concise. Would that be possible? 



Assistant: 
Yes, it's possible to implement an implicit operator in your `Option<T>` class that calls `.GetValueOrDefault()`. Here's an example using C#:

```csharp
public class Option<T>
{
    private T _value;
    // ... rest of your Option<T> class goes here

    public static implicit operator T(Option<T> option)
    {
        return option.GetValueOrDefault();
    }
}
```

This way, when you do something like this:

```csharp
Option<string> optionString = GetOptionString();

string text = optionString; // Implicit conversion
```
It will automatically call `.GetValueOrDefault()` on `optionString`, and `text` will contain that value. 

However, please note that this might lead to some confusing situations. Imagine you have an `Option<string>` which is actually none (not containing any value). Implicitly converting it to a string would give you null (or whatever default value you've defined), potentially leading to NullReferenceExceptions you'd not expect. 

It might be a better and clearer approach to always explicitly call `.GetValueOrDefault()` when you want to extract the value. This clearly signals that you are aware that you might not get a value back and that you're prepared to handle the default case.

Lastly, consider that the point of using optional types is to make your code safer by forcing you to think about the case where a value might not exist. Implicit conversion to the underlying type can somewhat circumvent this safety mechanism.

User: 
Currently I have a failing unit test (since changing MessageDetails.Text from string? to Option<string>) and I suspect this is because of the Json Deserializer in the following code not handling it right:


```c#
private static async Task<InputMessage> CreateInputMessageFromReaderAsync(DbDataReader reader)
{
    var telegramUserId = await reader.GetFieldValueAsync<long>(reader.GetOrdinal("user_id"));
    var telegramChatId = await reader.GetFieldValueAsync<long>(reader.GetOrdinal("chat_id"));
    var details = await reader.GetFieldValueAsync<string>(reader.GetOrdinal("details"));

    var message = new InputMessage(
        telegramUserId,
        telegramChatId,
        JsonHelper.DeserializeFromJsonStrict<MessageDetails>(details) 
        ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("Failed to deserialize"));

    return message;
}
```
 
Could that be the case? I assume the deserialiser is not smart enough to correctly convert a string from the details json into an Option<string> or you think it is?  Here for reference our Option<> class:

 
```c#
// ReSharper disable MemberCanBePrivate.Global
namespace CheckMade.Common.LanguageExtensions.MonadicWrappers;

public record Option<T>
{
    private readonly T? _value;
    private readonly bool _hasValue;

    private Option(T value)
    {
        _value = value;
        _hasValue = true;
    }

    private Option()
    {
        _value = default;
        _hasValue = false;
    }

    // Implicit conversion from T to Option<T>
    public static implicit operator Option<T>(T value) => Some(value);
    
    public static Option<T> Some(T value) => new Option<T>(value);
    public static Option<T> None() => new Option<T>();

    public bool IsSome => _hasValue;
    public bool IsNone => !_hasValue;

    public TResult Match<TResult>(Func<T, TResult> onSome, Func<TResult> onNone)
    {
        return _hasValue ? onSome(_value!) : onNone();
    }

    public T GetValueOrDefault(T defaultValue = default!)
    {
        return _hasValue ? _value! : defaultValue;
    }

    public T GetValueOrThrow()
    {
        if (_hasValue)
        {
            return _value!;
        }
        throw new InvalidOperationException("No value present");
    }
    
    public Option<TResult> SelectMany<TResult>(Func<T, Option<TResult>> binder)
    {
        return _hasValue ? binder(_value!) : Option<TResult>.None();
    }
}
```


Assistant: 
Yes, your assumption is correct. Json deserialization in your framework (whether it's .NET's built-in `System.Text.Json`, Newtonsoft.Json, or another lib) simply won't know how to handle `Option<T>` out of the box, because it doesn't know your domain-specific type. 

One possible solution for this would be create a custom `JsonConverter` for your `Option<T>` type.

Here is an example how you could do this with Newtonsoft.Json:

```csharp
public class OptionJsonConverter<T> : JsonConverter<Option<T>>
{
    public override Option<T> ReadJson(JsonReader reader, Type objectType, 
        Option<T> existingValue, bool hasExistingValue, JsonSerializer serializer)
    {
        T value = serializer.Deserialize<T>(reader);
        return value == null ? Option<T>.None() : Option<T>.Some(value);
    }

    public override void WriteJson(JsonWriter writer, Option<T> value, JsonSerializer serializer)
    {
        if (value.IsSome)
        {
            serializer.Serialize(writer, value.GetValueOrDefault());
        }
        else
        {
            serializer.Serialize(writer, null);
        }
    }
}
```
You can then use the `OptionJsonConverter` as following:

```csharp
string details = /* read from db or somewhere else */;
JsonSerializerSettings settings = new JsonSerializerSettings();

settings.Converters.Add(new OptionJsonConverter<string>());

MessageDetails deserialized = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<MessageDetails>(details, settings);

```
Just replace `JsonHelper.DeserializeFromJsonStrict<MessageDetails>(details)` with the correct way of doing deserialization using converter depending on your json library.

Note that this converter assumes that `null` values should be treated as `Option<T>.None()` and non-null values as `Option<T>.Some(value)`. Adjust this behavior according to your project's needs.

User: 
Hold on, we are currently using this JsonHelper class already. Can we not please just modify our existing DeserializeFromJsonStrict method please, and keep it all nicely encapsulated inside the JsonHelper? That's what it is for afterall, isn't it? 


```c#
using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace CheckMade.Common.Persistence;

public static class JsonHelper
{
    public static string SerializeToJson(object obj)
    {
        return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(obj);
    }

    public static T? DeserializeFromJsonStrict<T>(string json)
    {
        var jsonSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings
        {
            // Throws exception during deserialization when json data has a field that doesn't map to my model class
            MissingMemberHandling = MissingMemberHandling.Error
        };
        
        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(json, jsonSettings);
    }
}
```


Assistant: 
Certainly, you can modify the `JsonHelper` class to handle `Option<T>` during deserialization. You just need to add the `OptionJsonConverter` to the `JsonSerializerSettings`. Here's how you could do it:

```csharp
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using CheckMade.Common.LanguageExtensions.MonadicWrappers;

namespace CheckMade.Common.Persistence;

public static class JsonHelper
{
    public static string SerializeToJson(object obj)
    {
        return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(obj);
    }

    public static T? DeserializeFromJsonStrict<T>(string json)
    {
        var jsonSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings
        {
            MissingMemberHandling = MissingMemberHandling.Error
        };
        
        // Add converter to handle Option<T>
        jsonSettings.Converters.Add(new OptionJsonConverter<T>());

        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(json, jsonSettings);
    }
}
```
And your `OptionJsonConverter<T>` will look like this:

```csharp
public class OptionJsonConverter<T> : JsonConverter<Option<T>>
{
    public override Option<T> ReadJson(JsonReader reader, Type objectType, 
        Option<T> existingValue, bool hasExistingValue, JsonSerializer serializer)
    {
        T value = serializer.Deserialize<T>(reader);
        return value == null ? Option<T>.None() : Option<T>.Some(value);
    }

    public override void WriteJson(JsonWriter writer, Option<T> value, JsonSerializer serializer)
    {
        if (value.IsSome)
        {
            serializer.Serialize(writer, value.GetValueOrDefault());
        }
        else
        {
            serializer.Serialize(writer, null);
        }
    }
}
```

This approach ensures every time you call `JsonHelper.DeserializeFromJsonStrict<T>(json)`, it will correctly handle deserialization of `Option<T>` types.

User: 
Sorry but with this, I get the following error: Argument type 'CheckMade.Common.Persistence.JsonHelpers.OptionJsonConverter<T>' is not assignable to parameter type 'Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConverter'

on this line:


```c#
jsonSettings.Converters.Add(new OptionJsonConverter<T>());
```


Assistant: 
I see what has happened here, it's my mistake. The problem is that by using a generic `T` in `JsonHelper.DeserializeFromJsonStrict<T>(json)` for `OptionJsonConverter<T>`, we're trying to assign it as a converter for whatever type `T` is in the deserialization method. But we actually intended `OptionJsonConverter<T>` to convert `Option<T>`, not any arbitrary `T`. 

Instead of adding the converter in the `JsonHelper` class, we'll have to add it on the actual types that require it. 

We have two ways to solve this issue:

1. **Defining Known Converters in JsonHelper:** Here we can add check to see if type `T` is of `Option<some_type>` and we add the appropriate converter.

```csharp
public static class JsonHelper
{
    public static string SerializeToJson(object obj)
    {
        return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(obj);
    }

    public static T? DeserializeFromJsonStrict<T>(string json)
    {
        var jsonSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings
        {
            MissingMemberHandling = MissingMemberHandling.Error
        };
        
        Type typeParameterType = typeof(T);

        // check if T is of type Option<some_type>
        // and add converter for that specific type
        if (typeParameterType.IsGenericType &&
             typeParameterType.GetGenericTypeDefinition() == typeof(Option<>))
        {
            Type optionType = typeParameterType.GetGenericArguments()[0];

            Type converterType = typeof(OptionJsonConverter<>)
                .MakeGenericType(optionType);

            jsonSettings.Converters.Add((JsonConverter)Activator.CreateInstance(converterType));
        }

        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(json, jsonSettings);
    }
}
```

2. **Adding the Converter to Each Class with Option Fields:** Modify classes that have `Option<T>` fields to use the `OptionJsonConverter<T>`.

```csharp
[JsonConverter(typeof(OptionJsonConverter<string>))]
public Option<string> Value { get; set; }
```

Both approaches have their pros and cons - While the first one is highly automated and elegant, the second one is explicit.

User: 
Hold on, I think I misdiagnosed the problem. Let's start from scratch, here a new description:

Ok I'm facing the next problem while refactoring my code to use Option<string> for MessageDetails.Text.  The problem occurs in this code:

using Newtonsoft.Json;

namespace CheckMade.Common.Persistence.JsonHelpers;

public static class JsonHelper
{
public static string SerializeToJson(object obj)
{
return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(obj);
}

    public static T? DeserializeFromJsonStrict<T>(string json)
    {
        var jsonSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings
        {
            // Throws exception during deserialization when json data has a field that doesn't map to my model class
            MissingMemberHandling = MissingMemberHandling.Error
        };
        
        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(json, jsonSettings);
    }
}

Predictably, the Newtonsoft Serializer doesn't know how to convert my Option<string> property in MessageDetails into the json text i.e. instead of taking the value, I end up with this string in my json field in the database:  {\"IsSome\":true,\"IsNone\":false}

How can we fix this, please? Can we somehow smarten up our SerializeToJson method??  Or the Option<string> class itself?  Is the above string what I get when I'd  call  .ToString() on an instance of the Option<T> type? If so, could we not simply override what .ToString() on Option<T> does???



Assistant: 
The `{\"IsSome\":true,\"IsNone\":false}` json representation is the default serialization of your `Option<T>` class property fields.

A good way to handle this is to write a custom `JsonConverter`. It will provide the necessary logic to the `Newtonsoft` serializer on how to handle your `Option<T>` during serialization.

Let's modify the `OptionJsonConverter` to handle both serialization and deserialization:

```csharp
public class OptionJsonConverter<T> : JsonConverter<Option<T>>
{
    public override Option<T> ReadJson(JsonReader reader, Type objectType, 
        Option<T> existingValue, bool hasExistingValue, JsonSerializer serializer)
    {
        T value = serializer.Deserialize<T>(reader);
        return value == null ? Option<T>.None() : Option<T>.Some(value);
    }

    public override void WriteJson(JsonWriter writer, Option<T> value, JsonSerializer serializer)
    {
        if (value.IsSome)
        {
            serializer.Serialize(writer, value.GetValueOrDefault());
        }
        else
        {
            // Serialize as null if Option<T> has no value
            serializer.Serialize(writer, null);
        }
    }
}
```

Accordingly, we can modify `JsonHelper` to automatically utilize `OptionJsonConverter` when serializing any object that contains `Option<T>` properties:

```csharp
public static class JsonHelper
{
    public static string SerializeToJson(object obj)
    {
        var jsonSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings();
        // Add converter to handle Option<T>
        jsonSettings.Converters.Add(new OptionJsonConverter<object>());
        
        return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(obj, jsonSettings);
    }

    public static T? DeserializeFromJsonStrict<T>(string json)
    {
        var jsonSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings
        {
            MissingMemberHandling = MissingMemberHandling.Error
        };
        
        // Add converter to handle Option<T>
        jsonSettings.Converters.Add(new OptionJsonConverter<object>());

        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(json, jsonSettings);
    }
}
```

**Note:** Implementing `ToString()` in `Option<T>` won't fix the issue because JSON serialization doesn't use `ToString()`. It uses reflection to serialize the public properties or fields of a class, not their string representation.

This `OptionJsonConverter` now tells the serializer to store the value of `Option<T>` directly, if it has one, or as null if it does not. The custom converter is then added to the `SerializeToJson` and `DeserializeFromJsonStrict<T>` methods in `JsonHelper`.

User: 
This doesn't seem to have worked quite yet.  The Serializer still seems to convert an Option<string> instance into this: "Text\":{\"IsSome\":true,\"IsNone\":false},\"  Why?? 

Assistant: 
If the serializer is still generating the same output, it appears the custom `OptionJsonConverter` isn't being applied as expected.

The reason might be the `OptionJsonConverter<object>`. The converter expects the `T` in `Option<T>` and not the `Option<T>` itself, and therefore is not applied to the `Option<T>` properties.

Instead, we should use `OptionJsonConverter<T>` specifically for each `Option<T>` type in your data model.

Here is an approach:

**Firstly,** modify the `DeserializeFromJsonStrict` and `SerializeToJson` methods as follows:

```csharp
public static class JsonHelper
{
    public static string SerializeToJson(object obj)
    {
        var jsonSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings();
        return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(obj, jsonSettings);
    }

    public static T? DeserializeFromJsonStrict<T>(string json)
    {
        var jsonSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings
        {
            MissingMemberHandling = MissingMemberHandling.Error
        };

        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(json, jsonSettings);
    }
}
```

**Secondly,** for each `Option<T>` property in your classes, use `JsonConverter` attribute to specify the converter, like this:

```csharp
public class MessageDetails
{
    [JsonConverter(typeof(OptionJsonConverter<string>))]
    public Option<string> Text { get; set; }
    
    // other properties…
}
```

In this way, when Newtonsoft.Json serializes `MessageDetails`, it will use your `OptionJsonConverter<string>` to handle the `Text` property. This approach gives you full control over the serialization of each `Option<T>` property.

Please replace the `MessageDetails` and `Text` with your actual class and property names and add the `[JsonConverter(typeof(OptionJsonConverter<T>))]` attribute to all `Option<T>` type properties in your classes.

Remember to substitute `T` in `OptionJsonConverter<T>` with the actual type wrapped in `Option<T>`. For example, if you have a property of type `Option<int>`, you should use `[JsonConverter(typeof(OptionJsonConverter<int>))]`.

User: 
BUt what if I want to keep my classes as pristine POCOs, i.e. without attributes. Is there another solution that just consists of configuring the OptionJsonConverter and or the JsonHelper correctly? 

Assistant: 
Absolutely, I understand that you might want to keep your models clean from serialization-specific attributes. 

In Newtonsoft.Json, you can achieve this by using a `ContractResolver`. This allows you to specify how objects of a certain type should be serialized without having to modify the class itself. `ContractResolver` can be added per `JsonSerializerSettings` so you can modify it in your `JsonHelper` class.

Allow me to provide you with an example:

```csharp
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using Newtonsoft.Json.Serialization;
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Reflection;

public class OptionContractResolver : DefaultContractResolver
{
    protected override JsonContract CreateContract(Type objectType)
    {
        // if type is Option<T>
        if (objectType.IsGenericType && objectType.GetGenericTypeDefinition() == typeof(Option<>))
        {
            // get the underlying type T
            Type underlyingType = objectType.GetGenericArguments().First();

            // Create generic converter for Option<T> and set it to the contract
            var contract = base.CreateObjectContract(objectType);
            Type converterType = typeof(OptionJsonConverter<>).MakeGenericType(underlyingType);
            contract.Converter = (JsonConverter)Activator.CreateInstance(converterType);

            return contract;
        }

        return base.CreateContract(objectType);
    }
}

public static class JsonHelper
{
    public static string SerializeToJson(object obj)
    {
        var jsonSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings
        {
            ContractResolver = new OptionContractResolver() // assign the new contract resolver
        };
        return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(obj, jsonSettings);
    }

    public static T? DeserializeFromJsonStrict<T>(string json)
    {
        var jsonSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings
        {
            MissingMemberHandling = MissingMemberHandling.Error,
            ContractResolver = new OptionContractResolver() // assign the new contract resolver
        };

        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(json, jsonSettings);
    }
}
```

The `OptionContractResolver` checks if the type being serialized is a `Option<T>` and assigns a `OptionJsonConverter<T>` instance to be used in its serialization process. This approach guarantees all `Option<T>` in your entire application to be serialized using the `OptionJsonConverter<T>`, keeping your classes clean from attributes.

User: 
Wow this actually worked. Could you pleaes explain for my better understanding, what a ContractResolver is? It seems to effectively customise how  the serialization and deserialization works for a T, we need the combination of a derived, custom JsonConverter<T> like our OptionJsonConverter, plus a matching, derived DefaultContractResolver, in this case OptionContractResolver (which in turn gets applied to the JsonSerializerSettings).  Fine, I think I can track so far, that just seems to be the mechanism of Newtonsoft's library, yes?  The main thing I don't fully understand, I guess, is the code we have in OptionContractResolver.  This looks like it's working a lot with reflection. Can you explain a bit? 

Assistant: 
Absolutely! I'd be happy to provide some explanation.

**ContractResolver**

At a high level, `ContractResolver` is a tool that the Newtonsoft.Json library uses to determine how a particular object should be serialized or deserialized. 

In other words, it determines how the library interacts with your classes during the (de)serialization process. For instance, it controls which properties are (de)serialized, how property names are transformed (e.g. camelCase vs. PascalCase), if null values should be included, etc. 

When you create an instance of `JsonSerializerSettings`, it uses `DefaultContractResolver` by default. As its name suggests, `DefaultContractResolver`  provides a default behavior for (de)serializing objects.

**OptionContractResolver**

`OptionContractResolver` is a custom contract resolver which inherits from `DefaultContractResolver`. It overrides the `CreateContract` method to customize the (de)serialization behavior for classes of type `Option<T>`.

**Reflection in OptionContractResolver**

Yes, you spotted it! The `OptionContractResolver` uses reflection to identify if `T` is of type `Option<T>` and then to create an instance of `OptionJsonConverter<T>` for that specific type `T`. 

```csharp
if (objectType.IsGenericType && objectType.GetGenericTypeDefinition() == typeof(Option<>))
{
    Type underlyingType = objectType.GetGenericArguments().First();

    var contract = base.CreateObjectContract(objectType);
    Type converterType = typeof(OptionJsonConverter<>).MakeGenericType(underlyingType);
    contract.Converter = (JsonConverter)Activator.CreateInstance(converterType);

    return contract;
}
```

Here's an explanation of each line:

1. `if (objectType.IsGenericType && objectType.GetGenericTypeDefinition() == typeof(Option<>))`: This line checks if the current `objectType` being processed is a generic type and if it's an `Option<>` type.

2. `Type underlyingType = objectType.GetGenericArguments().First();`: If the `objectType` is indeed an `Option<>` type, this line retrieves the type of `T` within `Option<T>`.

3. `var contract = base.CreateObjectContract(objectType);`: It creates a standard contract for the `objectType` by calling the base implementation from `DefaultContractResolver`.

4. `Type converterType = typeof(OptionJsonConverter<>).MakeGenericType(underlyingType);`: This line creates a type object for `OptionJsonConverter<T>` with `T` replaced with the `underlyingType` we retrieved earlier.

5. `contract.Converter = (JsonConverter)Activator.CreateInstance(converterType);`: It then creates an instance of `OptionJsonConverter<T>` using the `Activator.CreateInstance` method and assigns it to `contract.Converter`. This tells Newtonsoft.Json to use your `OptionJsonConverter<T>` to (de)serialize the `Option<T>` object.

So essentially, `OptionContractResolver` checks if the current object being (de)serialized is of type `Option<T>`, and if so, instructs Newtonsoft.Json to use `OptionJsonConverter<T>` for the (de)serialization process.

User: 
Fascinating, thank you! 
I have two scenarios coming up soon where I will probably need additional customisations of (de)serialisation behaviour:

1. serialised details that contain nested types, that need to be deserialised (essentially those would be serialised aggregate entities). E.g. my type MessageDetail may in the future contain stronlgy typed properties, rather than just strings. Those would have to be serialised and deserialised.   

2. Pointers from deserialised objects to other objects that also need to be deserialised. I will avoid circular dependencies of course. But essentially, reconstituting an object graph based on references from some serialised objects to other objects. 

Do you know what I mean? Do I assume correctly that both these scenarios I'd also have to cover with additional custom JsonConverters and the corresponding ContractResolvers to add them to settings? 

Assistant: 
Yes, you are correct. The scenarios you described would likely require further customization to the serialization and deserialization process.

**1. Serialize and Deserialize Nested Types**

Newtonsoft.Json can automatically handle the serialization and deserialization of nested types.

However, if the nested types contain `Option<T>` properties or if you need special (de)serialization behavior for them, you would indeed need to create additional custom `JsonConverter`s and corresponding updates in the `ContractResolver`.

For example, let's say `MessageDetail` now has a nested `User` object:

```csharp
public class MessageDetail
{
   [JsonConverter(typeof(OptionJsonConverter<User>))]
   public Option<User> User { get; set; }
   
   // other properties…
}
```

You would create a `UserJsonConverter` similar to `OptionJsonConverter` and add `UserJsonConverter` to the `OptionContractResolver` similar to how `OptionJsonConverter` was added.

**2. Deserialize Object Graphs with References**

If you have objects that have references to other objects, Newtonsoft.Json allows preserving the object references in the JSON result. The library will add to the JSON an `$id` key for each object, and for each reference to that object, it will add a `$ref` key.

This behavior is not activated by default. To enable it, set `PreserveReferencesHandling` to `PreserveReferencesHandling.All` in `JsonSerializerSettings`.

However, if you need custom handling for the referenced objects, you might need custom `JsonConverter`s and the corresponding `ContractResolver`.

**Remember:** The examples above are generic. The specific solution will depend on your actual needs and on the structure of your classes. Always test your serialization and deserialization with various data cases to ensure they work as intended.

User: 
Let's explore whether I'd actually make use of 'PreserveReferencesHandling' or not. In my case, I have a stateless, serverless function that, on every invocation, reads from my database, which is kept quite flat, hence all the json details. 

This is a normal business operations database, with high level aggregate entities represented in the SQL schema, but everything else serialised into details, including references between lower level objects to each other (e.g. when a message, in its details, refers to a specific 'shower' object which itself is a detail of the aggregate 'sanitary_camp') as an example. 

So the function now needs to load the relevant entities, e.g. filtered by userId, and recreate the entire relevant object graph from these details in the database. 

In such case, would I  make use of PreserveReferencesHandling or does this require custom handling? 

Assistant: 
`PreserveReferencesHandling` is used when you are serializing and deserializing circular or complex object graphs, where an object is referenced multiple times and you want to maintain the reference integrity during deserialization.

In your case, since you're pulling flat data from a database and creating object graphs, you are mostly working with deserialization. The object references in your case are more like foreign keys in a database, not memory references in an object graph. Therefore, `PreserveReferencesHandling` might not be exactly what you need.

Moreover, since you mentioned "recreate the entire relevant object graph from these details in the database", it seems to imply constructing objects with relations based on the database data. This indicates that using straightforward deserialization might not suffice - you probably have some business rules or object relation rules that should be applied when constructing the objects. 

Custom handling would be a good decision in this case. Custom JsonConverter could provide fine control over how you deserialize and construct your objects according to your specific business logic. Depending on your object relationship and structure, you might also possibly need a factory or builder pattern for object creation. 

In the custom JsonConverter, you can utilize the JsonReader to navigate through the JSON content, apply rules and conditions to create and link the objects accordingly. 

Remember to fully unit test this part of the system as this will be crucial for correct data representation in your application.


User: 
Ok and am I assumign correctly, with no circular references present, I'd simply have to deserialise objects in my object graph in the reverse order, i.e. starting with the objects on the outer edge of the graph, that don't point to any other, and then working myself in to the root object(s) that  don't have any incoming connections, right? 

Assistant: 
While your assumption is generally correct, in practice, the order of deserialization would greatly depend on your particular use case, your data structure, and how you've set up your deserialization logic.

If every entity in the database is completely independent and only has references to other entities through ID-like properties, the order of deserialization may not be important since the objects do not directly reference each other.

However, if you want to build interconnected objects where the relationships are represented by actual in-memory references (and not just ID fields), then you indeed would need a certain order for deserialization. You would first deserialize the entities that do not depend on any other entities, then proceed with the entities that depend on the already deserialized entities.

In theory, this process is akin to a topological sort, where you process nodes of a graph in such a way that for every directed edge from node A to node B, node A comes before node B in the ordering.

But please note that this can get complex quickly if your entities have many interdependencies. If dependencies are complex, a better solution might be to deserialize all entities into simple, non-interconnected objects first, and only then build the necessary object graph in a second pass.

Remember, your approach might change drastically based on specific needs of your data and object model. It's critical to thoroughly analyze what you do with your data post-deserialization and therefore, adopt the approach that best fits your specific case.

User: 
How would I build an object graph in the second pass? I'd need to have unique ID's of objects that are referred to somehow stored in the referring object, right? 

Assistant: 
Yes, that's exactly right! When you deserialize your data in the first pass, you’d typically end up with a collection of objects which, besides their own data, contain identifiers (such as IDs) of the other objects they refer to.

In the second pass, you would then iterate over each of these objects, find the objects they refer to based on the stored identifiers, and replace these identifiers with the actual object references, building up the object graph in the process.

Here's a simplified example:

Let's say you have a class `Message` which refers to a class `User`.

```csharp
public class Message
{
    public string Text { get; set; }
    public User Sender { get; set; }
    public string SenderId { get; set; }    // Identifier used for deserialization
}

public class User
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

In the first pass, you'd deserialize your data. At this point, `Message.Sender` would be `null`, but `Message.SenderId` would contain the ID of the `User`.

```csharp
// First pass: Deserialize data
List<User> users = DeserializeUsers();
List<Message> messages = DeserializeMessages();
```

In the second pass, you'd use the identifiers to look up the actual objects and build your graph:

```csharp
// Second pass: Build object graph
foreach (var message in messages)
{
    message.Sender = users.First(user => user.Id == message.SenderId);
}
```

After the second pass, each `Message` now has a direct reference to its `Sender` `User`, and you've built up your object graph.

Please note that this is a simplified example and may not cover all complexities of your actual scenario. You'd need to adapt this approach based on your specific needs and object relationships. Also, error handling (e.g., what happens if a `User` for a specific ID isn't found) is extremely important in this context.

User: 
Noooo, now the mechanism is polluting my domain pocos.  I wouldn't want that! So I need to stick to the ordered deserialisation in one pass, yes? Shouldn't be a problem though since I'm avoiding circular references completely....  And of course, the assumption is, that every type of entity object would have some property that uniquely identifies it (e.g. an email address for a User) while for pure value objects without a real-life identity (like an address) that doesn't matter, correct? 

Assistant: 
Yes, you're correct on both counts. 

If you don't want to add additional fields for deserialization to your domain model (which would indeed pollute it), it's advisable to proceed with ordered deserialization where objects that have dependencies are deserialized only after the objects they depend on have been fully deserialized. As you said, avoiding circular references simplifies this a lot.

As for the identifying property, indeed, each entity should have some kind of unique identifier. This is usually an ID, but it could certainly be something like an email address for a user if that's guaranteed to be unique. For value objects without an identity, such as an address, this wouldn't be necessary.

Also, remember that quite often an aggregate will contain collections of value objects (like a User having a collection of Addresses), keeping the complexity of the graph reasonably manageable. It's mainly inter-aggregate connections (like a Message referring to a User) that might require careful handling.

Just remember to exhaustively test various cases after setting up your custom converters!
